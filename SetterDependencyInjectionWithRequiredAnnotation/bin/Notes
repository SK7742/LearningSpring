In Case of Dependency Check attribute, We need to set either none/normal/objects/all.
Suppose we are working with oracle db then we need all details like, connection url, username, password etc, then as we 
know all these properties are mandatory to pass while connection creation then for this scenario we can proceed with
dependency check attribute.
But If we are working with MySQL DB then password is an optional field so it may or may not to be configured for the password.
So in this case we need to pass all the attribute except password, So if we use dependency-check attribute then it is not possible to 
avoid the password field settor method, Hence we can't use dependency-check attribute here.

To Overcome this issue, @Required attribute is used.
if we want to invoke setter method of a particular data then we will use @Required annotation.
